                <h2 class="major">Creating A Custom Dataset Of Mr. Sinatra's Lyrics</h2>
                <p>When creating a project such as this, the first task at hand
                    is to gather all necessary data, and clean it. Luckily for me,
                    there are numerous methods to collect lyric data off of websites,
                    a process called web-scraping. In order to scrape the lyrics, you can
                    use one of two methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scraping the html content of the website.</li>
                    <li>Using an API provided by the website host.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The first method of getting each song's lyric page's html content
                    and then parsing through to find and store just the lyrics, is
                    as tedious as it sounds. The second method of using an API
                    is far more simpler. Albeit, an API usually requires some sort of
                    subscription/access key which can only be obtained by signing
                    up at the host's website.<br>
                    In this project, I opted to use a website called Genius's API
                    to scrape Mr. Sinatra's lyrics.</p>

                <h3>Scraping Lyrics Using The Genius API</h3>
                <p>Genius is a website where users can upload explanations
                    to any song's lyrics. The explanations can then be voted on
                    by other users. The Genius API allows registered users to
                    interact with the sites functionalities, one of which includes
                    getting the lyrics.<br>
                    Below you can see the snippet of code I used to retrieve and
                    save all the related lyrics. Mind you, this code should work
                    for any singer that is on Genius.com, you just have to spell
                    the name right. The "GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN" refers to the
                    passcode that allows me to interact with the Genius API. It
                    is obtained by registering on the website.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/5a90a11e02cc2b9ddaf274bd592d91a6.js"></script>
                <h3>Cleaning The Lyrics Data</h3>
                <p><span class="image right"><img
                        src="../images/sinatra_lyrics_generator_rnn/lyrics_json_screenshot.png" alt=""></span>
                    As you can see on the right, the downloaded lyrics were saved in a JSON file
                    that was too long to be human-readable. So, I decided to parse through this
                    JSON file, and make it more human-friendly by converting it into a simple CSV
                    file.</p>
                <p>Parsing through the JSON and creating a CSV of just the relevant information
                    took an entire script on its own. In fact, the main reason it took an entire day,
                    as well as multiple iterations was because of the JSON data.<br>
                    You see, the JSON data, direct from the API, was faulty and unclean. The
                    lyric's data, as well as each song's metadata was filled with unwanted, non-parseable,
                    and non-human-readable characters. In order to tackle this problem, I had to
                    iterate through each song, and remove any unwanted characters. As you can
                    see from my code snippet below, the API returned a tremendous amount of unique
                    unwanted characters.<br>
                    The punctuations were optional to remove, as certain
                    character-level RNN models treat those as tokens. However, I wanted to remove
                    punctuation, as songs lyrics contained periods and commas at most.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/b9fe1643fdb6adf89db977713ac72608.js"></script>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/sinatra_lyrics_generator_rnn/lyrics_csv_screenshot.png"
                                                 alt=""></span>
                    With my lyrics-cleaning done, I finally had my cleaned CSV file, which you can
                    see on the left. I had decided to keep certain metadata about each song, as it
                    might come into use for another project (perhaps to create a song title generator).<br>
                    Mind you, the way I have this project set up in the GitHub repo, you can replace the artist's name
                    with any artist you want, and at the end you will have a fully trained RNN lyrics generator for that
                    artist.</p>
                <p>All that was left was to iterate through my CSV file, and create a simple text file of ONLY the
                    lyrics which I can load into my RNN script. ALAS, I was finally done with just gathering and
                    cleaning the data.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Loading The Dataset For The Model</h2>
                <p>For all RNN character-level text generation models, the process is generally the same. Assuming we
                    have cleaned data at the ready, all we have to do is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Load the data into a variable.</li>
                    <li>Generate a vocabulary (basically convert our data into a set of unique words or letters).</li>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/224361d2d05d6fd164210d52bcca0cf6.js"></script>
                    <li>Create functions to aid in conversion between each letter and its corresponding ID. We use these
                        to generate all IDs in our data.
                    </li>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/2720c39e79895040e5d29d1055ce1da2.js"></script>
                    <li>Define a sequence length and split our data into sequences, thus generating a dataset.</li>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/dfa7782f1c980aca9d6a951a90247dfd.js"></script>
                </ol>
                <p>Now we can focus on creating and training the actual model itself.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Creating The RNN Model</h2>
                <p>We need to first define the embedding dimension as well as the number of
                    RNN units (GRUs - Gated Recurrent Units) before we can define the LyricsGeneratorModel
                    class.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/8a590522b4514872457e1182349fd2cb.js"></script>

                <p>As a sanity check, we can see the next-char predictions of the untrained model:</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/c63caf58a552849c793ef83b07149cb5.js"></script>
                <p>We get the following output:</p>
                <pre><code>
Input: b's i see soon begins bewitching me its that old devil moon that you stole from the skies its that old'
Next char predictions:
b't[UNK]vtbpszf nqycgt uwweyzryjcxsdeiqqag uo fobxzqmqqsxmmv lxxbvizzmuubptzikawishqnlp lntuwxgnwud[UNK]maqlrp'
                </code></pre>

                <h2 class="major">Compiling And Fitting The Model</h2>
                <p>Finally, we can choose a loss function, and train our model.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/hannankhan888/1cb3a3dd802bafb4b71dfcc3dfc4e4ab.js"></script>
                <p>
                    In my case, I chose to go with 80 epochs of training. I believe that this led
                    to my model being over-fit, as you can notice when you play with the deployed version.
                    Sometimes, the sentences generated are too accurate, and even spot on with
                    Mt. Sinatra's most famous lyrics (im looking at you 'Fly me to the moon'!).
                </p>
                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img
                        src="../images/sinatra_lyrics_generator_rnn/overfit_example_webapp.png" alt=""/></span></div>

                <p>
                    Over the 80 epochs, as you can see below, the lowest training loss I achieved
                    was only 0.09. This definitely indicates an over-fit model.</p>
                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img
                        src="../images/sinatra_lyrics_generator_rnn/rnn_training_loss.png" alt=""/></span></div>

                <h2 class="major">Takeaways/Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>I have definitely over-fit this model. If I were to train again, I would go
                    for both less model complexity and less training epochs.</p>
                <p>As for the data. Next time would be a great time to further clean the
                    data itself. Perhaps create a word-level RNN lyrics generator instead of a
                    character-level one.</p>
                <p>With the way I have the CSV file structured, I would even be able to train
                    another RNN solely to generate a song title in the like of Frank Sinatra. That
                    would make for a really nice, complete webapp.</p>
                <p>For now, you can visit the webapp and the entire code repository, linked below.</p>
