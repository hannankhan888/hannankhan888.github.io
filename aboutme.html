                <h3 class="major">My Personal Background</h3>
                <span class="image right"><img src="images/headshot_sq_top_less.jpg" alt=""/></span>
                <p>I was born in India, where I stayed for 7 years before my
                    parents decided to immigrate to the United States in search
                    of a better education for their children. <br>
                    We landed on March 1st, 2005 to an icy-cold day in New York.
                    Having gone from Hyderabad, India straight to NY was very
                    overwhelming. Needless to say, my family's time in The Big
                    Apple did not last long. After only 6 months in snowy conditions
                    my parents decided to move us to Dallas, Texas in search
                    of better living conditions and schools.<br>
                    The city we moved to is a suburb of Dallas and a small town
                    at the time, Carrollton. Over the years since, we have not
                    moved, and I got to grow and develop with this town. If you
                    were to ask me what my hometown was, I would say Carrollton
                    especially since I feel as if I had contributed to the evolution
                    of this little town.</p>
                <h3 class="major">My Educational Background</h3>
                <p>My childhood education (elementary, middle, and high school)
                    was based entirely in Carrollton, Texas. In high school, I had
                    decided that I was going to pursue a medical education, with
                    hopes of getting into medical school. I decided to join the
                    BioMedical Academy at my high school, which I did not
                    complete. Instead, I opted to early graduate out of high
                    school (after many night school and summer school classes).<br>
                    With the goal of medical school in mind, I completed my
                    Bachelors in Neuroscience (Pre-Med) from the University of
                    Texas at Dallas. Upon graduating, my GPA had not met the
                    standards set by medical schools. At this point, I had two options:
                    spend two more years in undergraduate courses for a chance at
                    admission into medical school, OR pursue one of my passions'
                    statistics/data in the form of a graduate degree.<br>
                    I chose the latter in June 2019. After the long journey of one
                    year of prerequisites, and 2 more years of graduate school, I obtained my Masters
                    in Computer Science (with specializations in AI and Algorithms/Theory)
                    from the University of Texas at Arlington.</p>
                <h3 class="major">My Hobbies/Interests</h3>
                <p>First off, even though it sounds clich√©, I LOVE programming!
                    I really like tackling the large problems that programming can solve,
                    all the while having the computer do all the work. I also
                    especially love when I finally crack those pesky error codes
                    for which there's no solution available online.<br>
                    Apart from programming, I also like cycling (road/mountain bikes)
                    and beating my PB's on the local green belt trails. I am also an
                    avid weight lifter, and try to fit in a workout session whenever
                    possible. In terms of gaming, I usually play racing, simulation, or casual
                    games the most. Currently, my most played games are The Crew 2,
                    Rocket League, and Snowrunner.<br>
                    Even more recently, I have been tackling role-playing adventure games, such as
                    Uncharted and Tomb Raider.</p>
