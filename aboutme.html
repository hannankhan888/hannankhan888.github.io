									<h3 class="major">My Personal Background</h3>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/headshot_sq_top_less.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I was born in India, where I stayed for 7 years before my
										parents decided to immigrate to the United States in search
										of a better education for their children. <br>
										We landed on March 1st, 2005 to a icy-cold day in New York.
										Having gone from Hyderabad, India straight to NY was very
										overwhelming. Needless to say, my family's time in The Big
										Apple did not last long. After only 6 months in snowy conditions
										my parents decided to move us to Dallas, Texas in search
										of better living conditions and schools.<br>
										The city we moved to was a suburb of Dallas, a small town
										at the time, Carrollton. Over the years since, we have not
										moved, and I got to grow and develop with this town. If you
										were to ask me what my hometown was, I would say Carrollton
										especially since I feel as if I had contributed to the evolution
										of this little town.</p>
									<h3 class="major">My Educational Background</h3>
									<p>My childhood education (elementary, middle, and high school)
										was based entirely in Carrollton, Texas. In high school, I had
										decided that I was going to pursue a medical education, with
										hopes of getting into medical school. I decided to join the
										BioMedical Academy at my high school, which I did not
										complete. Instead, I opted to early graduate out of high
										school (after many night school and summer school classes).<br>
										With the goal of medical school in mind, I completed my
										Bachelors in Neuroscience (Pre-Med) from the University of
										Texas at Dallas. Upon graduating, my GPA had not met the
										standards set by medical schools. At this point, I had two options:
										spend two more years in undergraduate courses for a chance at
										admission into medical school, OR pursue one of my passions
										statistics/data in the form of a graduate degree.<br>
										I chose the latter in June of 2019. After the long journey of one
										year of prerequisites, and 2 more years of graduate school, I obtained my Masters
										in Computer Science (with specializations in AI and Algorithms/Theory)
										from the University of Texas at Arlington.</p>
